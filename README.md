# Nightshift: don't listen

A **text-based horror survival game** inspired by *Five Nights at Freddy’s*, where sound analysis, decision-making, and command typing are your only defenses.

No graphics.  
No jump scares on screen.  
Just information, sounds… and something trying to reach you.

## Introduction

**Nightshift: don't listen** is a minimalist horror game where the player survives night shifts using **only textual information and audio cues**.  
You are confined to a control room interface displaying system statuses, logs, and alerts.

During the night, an unknown entity moves toward you.  
You must **listen carefully**, **analyze sounds**, and **type the correct commands at the right time** to survive.

One mistake, one late reaction… and the night is over.
